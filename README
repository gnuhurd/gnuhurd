JTVevents is a sample project to demonstrate how to interface with the justin.tv
API.  It uses libevent's evhttp server framework.  The XML parsing is done by
libexpat, and the javascript portions of the code rely on JQuery.

The initial version was written by Eric Sumner.  If you have any questions
about the implementation here or wish to submit a patch, please contact
eric@justin.tv .
